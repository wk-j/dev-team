# First Contact — Onboarding Experience

## Philosophy
Onboarding into FlowState isn't a tutorial — it's a **birth ceremony**. New users don't learn features; they **awaken into the void** and discover their place in the constellation.

---

## The Awakening Sequence

### Stage 1: The Void Emerges
**Duration**: 3 seconds

User sees only darkness. Then:
1. A single point of light appears (distant star)
2. Light slowly expands
3. Particles begin to drift past
4. The void reveals its depth

**Narration** (subtle, optional):
> "Before there were tasks, there was energy. Before there were teams, there were connections."

---

### Stage 2: Your Star is Born
**Duration**: Interactive (30-60 seconds)

A nebula cloud forms at screen center:

```
    ·  ·  ·
  ·  ╭───╮  ·
 ·  ╱ ≋≋≋ ╲  ·
   │ ≋≋≋≋≋ │
 ·  ╲ ≋≋≋ ╱  ·
  ·  ╰───╯  ·
    ·  ·  ·

   "You are forming..."
```

**User Actions:**
1. **Name your presence**: Input field appears within nebula
   - "What shall we call you in the void?"
   - Input: `Sarah Chen`

2. **Choose your energy signature**: Color picker orbits the forming star
   - "Choose the color of your light"
   - Options: Cyan, Violet, Gold, Rose, Emerald, Custom

3. **Star ignites**: Upon completion
   - Nebula contracts rapidly
   - Flash of chosen color
   - User's celestial body now exists

```
       ★
    Your star
    is born.
```

---

### Stage 3: Discovering the Constellation
**Duration**: 20-30 seconds

Camera pulls back to reveal team constellation:

```
                    ★ You (pulsing)
                   ╱
          ★ ─────★
         ╱       ╲
        ★         ★
       (Team already here)
```

**Narration**:
> "You've joined a constellation. These are your fellow travelers."

**Interactions:**
- Each existing team member's star glows in sequence
- Names appear briefly beside each
- Connection lines fade in showing relationships

---

### Stage 4: Understanding Energy
**Duration**: Interactive (45-60 seconds)

A dormant seed appears near the user:

```
    ○ "Your first spark"
    │
    └── A work item waiting
        for your energy
```

**Tutorial Sequence:**

1. **Observe the seed**
   > "Work begins as dormant seeds. Ideas waiting to grow."
   
2. **Infuse energy** (guided action)
   > "Hold and drag your energy into the seed."
   - User drags from their star to the seed
   - Visual: Energy trail flows from user to seed
   
3. **Watch it kindle**
   > "See how it responds to your touch?"
   - Seed transforms: ○ → ◐
   - Warm glow, flickering animation
   
4. **Feel the blaze**
   > "As you focus, energy intensifies."
   - Auto-progression for demo: ◐ → ●
   - Bright, pulsing light

5. **Witness crystallization**
   > "Completed work becomes permanent. A crystal in your garden."
   - Item transforms: ● → ◇
   - Celebration animation
   - Crystal floats to Crystal Garden area

---

### Stage 5: Exploring Streams
**Duration**: 30-40 seconds

Camera pans to show a flowing stream:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  ~~~~ Welcome Stream ~~~~ 
═══════════════════════════════════════════
      ○   ◐   ●   ◐   ○
    (items flowing through)
```

**Narration**:
> "Work flows through streams — rivers of effort your team contributes to."

**Interactions:**
1. **See the flow**: Particles moving along the stream
2. **Dive invitation**: 
   > "Ready to dive in? Click the stream."
3. **Brief dive experience**: 
   - Camera zooms into stream
   - Immersive view for 5 seconds
   - "Surface" button appears
4. **Return to Observatory**

---

### Stage 6: Resonance Introduction
**Duration**: 20-30 seconds

Another team member's star pulses toward user:

```
    ★ Teammate
     ╲
      ~~~ ping ~~~
           ╲
            ★ You
```

**Narration**:
> "When teammates reach out, you'll feel a resonance ping."

**Demo:**
1. A gentle ripple travels from teammate to user
2. Ping arrives with soft glow effect
3. Message appears: "Welcome to the team! 🌟 — Alex"
4. User learns to acknowledge

**Sending Practice:**
> "Try sending a ping back."
- User selects teammate star
- Chooses ping type (guided to "gentle")
- Watches ping travel

---

### Stage 7: Your Orbital State
**Duration**: 15-20 seconds

UI overlay appears around user's star:

```
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │ Your Orbital State      │
    │                         │
    │ ◉ Open Orbit           │
    │   (available)           │
    │                         │
    │ ○ Deep Work Orbit      │
    │   (focused)             │
    │                         │
    │ ○ Recovery Orbit       │
    │   (recharging)          │
    └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Narration**:
> "Control when you're available. Deep Work shields you from interruptions."

**Quick Demo:**
1. User toggles to Deep Work
2. Shield visual appears around their star
3. Narration: "Others see you're focused. Pings will wait."
4. Return to Open Orbit

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Completion Rate | > 85% | Is onboarding too long? |
| Time to Complete | 3-5 min | Engagement without boredom |
| First Action After | < 30 sec | Do users feel ready? |
| Return After 24h | > 70% | Did onboarding hook them? |
| Skip Rate | < 15% | Is value clear early? |
