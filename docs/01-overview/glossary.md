# FlowState Glossary

A complete reference of terminology used in the FlowState universe. Share this with new team members to help them understand the language of the void.

---

## Core Concepts

### The Void
The infinite, dark canvas that contains the entire FlowState universe. Not a "page" or "screen" — a living space you navigate through by panning, zooming, and flying.

### Energy
The fundamental unit of work in FlowState. Instead of tracking tasks, we track energy — how much focus and effort is being directed at something.

### Flow
The natural movement of work and attention. FlowState is designed to induce and protect flow states in users, not interrupt them.

---

## Energy States

Work items progress through five energy states:

### Dormant ○
A seed of work that hasn't received energy yet. Ideas, backlog items, or future possibilities waiting to be activated. Visually dim, pulsing slowly.

**Traditional equivalent**: Backlog item, "To Do"

### Kindling ◐
Work that has begun receiving energy. Someone is starting to focus on it. Warm glow, flickering animation as momentum builds.

**Traditional equivalent**: "In Progress" (early stage)

### Blazing ●
Peak energy state. Full focus, active work happening right now. Bright, radiant, pulsing with intensity.

**Traditional equivalent**: "In Progress" (active focus)

### Cooling ◐
Work nearing completion. Energy is settling, final touches being made. Soft glow, slowing pulse, preparing for crystallization.

**Traditional equivalent**: "In Review", "Almost Done"

### Crystallized ◇
Completed work. Energy has solidified into permanent value. Solid, reflective, added to the Crystal Garden forever.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Done", "Completed"

---

## Work Item Depth

Work items have a depth level indicating their complexity and effort required:

### Shallow
Quick tasks that can be completed in a short time. Surface-level work.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Small", "Quick win", "1 story point"

### Medium
Standard work items requiring moderate effort. The default depth.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Medium", "3 story points"

### Deep
Complex work requiring significant focus and time. Multiple sessions needed.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Large", "5 story points"

### Abyssal
Massive undertakings requiring extended deep work. Epic-level complexity.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Epic", "8+ story points"

---

## Workspace Elements

### Observatory
The main view of FlowState — a cosmic viewport showing the team constellation, active streams, and aggregate metrics. This is "home."

**Traditional equivalent**: Dashboard

### Stream
A continuous flow of related work. Streams have direction, velocity, and depth. Multiple team members can "dive" into the same stream.

**Traditional equivalent**: Project, Epic, Board

### Constellation
The visual arrangement of team members as celestial bodies. Shows relationships, connections, and current states at a glance.

**Traditional equivalent**: Team page, Org chart

### Crystal Garden
A growing collection of all crystallized (completed) work. Each crystal represents delivered value and forms patterns over time.

**Traditional equivalent**: Completed tasks archive, Velocity chart

### Sanctum
Your personal settings space — a private pocket dimension where you customize your existence in FlowState.

**Traditional equivalent**: Settings page, Profile

### Pulse Core
A visual representation of team activity rhythm. Shows the "heartbeat" of collective work — faster when busy, slower when quiet.

**Traditional equivalent**: Activity chart, Team velocity

---

## Team & People

### Celestial Body
How team members appear in the void — as stars, planets, or other luminous objects based on their role and seniority.

### Star Types

| Type | Symbol | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Sun** | ★ | Team leads, highest influence |
| **Giant Star** | ◐ | Senior members |
| **Main Sequence** | ● | Core team |
| **Dwarf Star** | ○ | Junior members |
| **Neutron Star** | ◇ | Specialists |

### Energy Signature
Your personal color that appears in all your glows, trails, and contributions. Chosen during onboarding, changeable in Sanctum.

### Resonance
The quality of connection between two team members. Higher resonance = more collaboration, better sync, stronger relationship.

### Resonance Score
A numeric value (0-100) representing the strength of connection between two people, based on collaboration history.

---

## Orbital States

How available a person is for interaction:

### Open
Default state. Available for pings, open to collaboration. Wide, welcoming aura around celestial body.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Available", Online status

### Focused
Light focus state. Working but still interruptible. Subtle glow indicates activity.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Busy", "Working"

### Deep Work
Intense focus state. Minimizing interruptions, in flow. Protective shield visual, pings are queued.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Do Not Disturb", Focus mode

### Away
Away from keyboard or in a meeting. Dimmed appearance, slow pulse.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Away", "In a meeting", "Out of Office"

### Supernova
Peak performance, shipping major work. Explosive visual, high energy output.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Crushing it" (no real equivalent)

---

## Actions & Interactions

### Spark
Create a new work item. You're not "creating a task" — you're planting a seed of potential work.

**Traditional equivalent**: Create task, Add item

### Infuse
Begin working on a dormant item by transferring your energy to it. The item begins to glow with your color.

**Traditional equivalent**: Assign to self, Start work

### Dive
Enter a stream for focused work. The interface shifts to immersive mode, other elements fade.

**Traditional equivalent**: Open project, Focus on board

### Surface
Exit from a dive, return to Observatory view. Come up for air, see the bigger picture.

**Traditional equivalent**: Go back, Return to dashboard

### Crystallize
Complete a work item, transforming it into a permanent crystal. Triggers celebration animation.

**Traditional equivalent**: Mark as done, Complete

### Ping
Send a message/notification to a teammate. Three intensities:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Gentle Ripple** | Async, arrives softly, no urgency |
| **Warm Pulse** | Delivered when recipient is available |
| **Direct Beam** | Urgent, arrives immediately |

**Traditional equivalent**: @mention, DM, Notification

### Handoff / Pass the Torch
Transfer primary ownership of a work item to another person. Your energy fades, theirs ignites.

**Traditional equivalent**: Reassign, Hand off

---

## Stream Operations

### Fork
Split a stream into two separate streams when work needs to diverge.

**Traditional equivalent**: Create sub-project, Branch

### Merge
Combine two streams when separate efforts need to unite.

**Traditional equivalent**: Merge projects, Combine boards

### Evaporate
Archive a completed or abandoned stream. It fades but remains searchable.

**Traditional equivalent**: Archive project, Close board

### Reconstitute
Bring back an evaporated stream if work needs to resume.

**Traditional equivalent**: Reopen project, Unarchive

---

## Stream States

Streams progress through different states based on activity and lifecycle:

### Nascent
A newly created stream that hasn't gained momentum yet. Dim, forming appearance with potential energy.

**Traditional equivalent**: "New", "Draft project"

### Flowing
Normal, healthy pace. Steady movement of particles along the stream path.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Active", "In progress"

### Rushing
High velocity, lots of activity. Fast-moving particles, bright glow.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Hot", "High priority"

### Flooding
Too much work, needs attention. Overflowing visual, warning indicators.

**Traditional equivalent**: "Overloaded", "At risk"

### Stagnant
Blocked or abandoned. Slow, murky appearance, needs intervention.
