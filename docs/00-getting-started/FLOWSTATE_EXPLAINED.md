# 🌟 FlowState - Complete Functionality Explained

## 🎯 What is FlowState?

FlowState is a **visual team energy tracker** that shows your team's work as a living 3D universe where:
- **Team members** = Glowing stars (celestial bodies)
- **Work streams** = Flowing energy rivers  
- **Tasks** = Energy orbs that flow through streams
- **Completed work** = Crystals in a garden

Think of it as **GitHub meets a cosmic energy visualization** - practical task tracking with beautiful metaphors.

## 🎮 How Everything Works Together

### The Workflow

```
1. CREATE A STREAM (in /streams)
   ↓
2. ADD WORK ITEMS to stream (click "+ Spark Item")
   ↓
3. WORK ON ITEMS (they change state as you progress)
   ↓
4. COLLABORATE with team (send pings, handoff work)
   ↓
5. COMPLETE ITEMS (they become crystals)
   ↓
6. VIEW PROGRESS (in Observatory 3D view)
```

## 📊 Work Item Lifecycle (The Energy States)

Work items go through **5 energy states** as you work on them:

### 1. ○ **Dormant** (Not Started)
- **What it is**: Task created but nobody's started it yet
- **Looks like**: Dim gray sphere
- **Energy level**: 0%
- **What to do**: Click it to "kindle" (start working)

### 2. ◐ **Kindling** (Just Started)
- **What it is**: Someone started working on it
- **Looks like**: Orange flickering orb
- **Energy level**: 1-40%
- **What to do**: Keep working, update as you progress

### 3. ● **Blazing** (Active Work)
- **What it is**: In full swing, making progress
- **Looks like**: Bright yellow pulsing sphere
- **Energy level**: 41-90%
- **What to do**: Push it to completion!

### 4. ◑ **Cooling** (Almost Done)
- **What it is**: Wrapping up, final touches
- **Looks like**: Purple fading orb
- **Energy level**: 91-99%
- **What to do**: Finish and crystallize!

### 5. ◇ **Crystallized** (DONE!)
- **What it is**: Complete! Permanent achievement
- **Looks like**: Faceted crystal gem
- **Energy level**: 100%
- **What happens**: Shows in Crystal Garden, counts toward team stats

## 🎨 Understanding the Visual Metaphors

### Why "Streams"?
Think of a **river of work**:
- Water flows from source to destination
- Work flows from idea to completion
- Multiple items can flow simultaneously
- Sometimes it rushes, sometimes it's calm

**Stream States**:
- **Nascent** = Just created, barely flowing
- **Flowing** = Normal healthy pace ✅
- **Rushing** = High velocity, lots happening
- **Flooding** = TOO MUCH, needs help! 🚨
- **Stagnant** = Blocked, nothing moving
- **Evaporated** = Archived, no longer active

### Why "Energy Orbs"?
Work items have **energy** that increases as you work:
- Starting = Low energy (dormant)
- Working = Building energy (kindling → blazing)
- Completing = Crystallizing energy into permanent form

### Why "Crystals"?
Completed work **crystallizes** into permanent gems:
- Can't be undone (preserved achievements)
- Have **facets** (quality/complexity)
- Have **brilliance** (value/impact)
- Displayed in a garden (trophy case)

### Why "Resonance"?
Team collaboration creates **resonance** (connection strength):
- Like musical instruments in harmony
- Grows through working together
- Shows as glowing lines between members
- Higher resonance = better teamwork

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Your First Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Create a Stream
```
1. Go to /streams
2. Click "+ New Stream"
3. Name it (e.g., "Backend API")
4. Add description (optional)
5. Click "Create Stream"
```

### Step 2: Add Work Items
```
1. On /streams page, find your stream
2. Click "+ Spark Item" button
3. Enter task details:
   - Title: "Add user authentication"
   - Description: "Implement OAuth2 login"
   - Depth: "deep" (complex task)
4. Click "Spark Item ✨"
```

### Step 3: View in 3D
```
1. Go to /observatory
2. See your stream flowing with the work item
3. Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom
4. Click the stream to "dive in"
```

### Step 4: Work on Items
```
In dive mode:
1. See your work item as a gray orb (dormant)
2. Click it to "kindle" (start working)
3. It turns orange (kindling state)
4. As you work in real life, update its energy level
5. When done, set to "crystallized"
```

### Step 5: Collaborate
```
1. Go to /constellation
2. Click a teammate's profile
3. Click "Infuse Energy" to handoff work item
4. OR click "Send Ping" to message them
```

### Step 6: See Results
```
1. Go back to /observatory
2. See your crystal in the Crystal Garden
3. Check team stats (crystals count increased!)
4. View resonance connections with collaborators
```

## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### What is "Diving"?
**Diving** = Focusing on a specific stream
- Click a stream in Observatory
- Enter full-screen immersive mode
- See only that stream's work items
- See who else is "diving" there
- Like "opening a project" to work on it

### What is a "Ping"?
**Ping** = Quick message to a teammate
- 3 types based on urgency:
  - 🟢 **Gentle**: Low priority, delivered later
  - 🟡 **Warm**: Normal priority, delivered when they're available
  - 🔴 **Direct**: Urgent, delivered immediately
- Can include a message
- Increases resonance between you

### What is "Infuse Energy"?
**Infuse Energy** = Handoff work to someone
- Transfer a dormant work item to a teammate
- They become the primary "diver" (owner)
- Useful for delegation or collaboration
- Increases resonance

### What is "Orbital State"?
**Orbital State** = Your availability status
- 🟢 **Open**: Available, not focused on anything
- 🟡 **Focused**: Working on something, but can be interrupted
- 🔴 **Deep Work**: Do not disturb! In the zone
- ⚫ **Away**: Offline or unavailable
- ✨ **Supernova**: Celebrating a big win!

You can change yours in `/sanctum` (settings)

| See the big picture | `/observatory` | View 3D space |
| Create a new project | `/streams` | Click "+ New Stream" |
| Add a task | `/streams` | Click "+ Spark Item" on a stream |
| Message a teammate | `/constellation` | Click their profile → "Send Ping" |

## 🎯 The Core Philosophy

FlowState is built on these principles:

1. **Visual > Numbers**: See energy flow, don't just read stats
2. **Collaboration > Competition**: Resonance grows when helping others
3. **Progress > Perfection**: Kindling → Blazing → Crystallized (small steps)
4. **Energy > Time**: Track engagement, not just hours
5. **Team > Individual**: Everyone's work flows together

---

## 🔍 Reading the Observatory (What Am I Looking At?)

When you open `/observatory`, you see:

### Top Bar
- **Team Pulse**: How active is everyone? (like heart rate)
- **Active Streams**: How many work streams are flowing
- **Crystals Today**: How many tasks completed today
- **Team Diving**: How many people are focused right now

### 3D Space
- **Floating Stars** = Your teammates (hover to see name/role)
- **Curved Lines** = Work streams (different colors = different states)
- **Glowing Orbs on Lines** = Work items flowing through streams
- **Connections Between Stars** = Team collaboration (resonance)
- **Crystal Garden Below** = Completed work (your trophy case)

### What Good Looks Like
✅ Multiple streams flowing (not all stagnant)
✅ Work items progressing through states
✅ Team members spread across streams (distributed work)
✅ Strong resonance connections visible
✅ Crystals accumulating in the garden

### What Needs Attention
🚨 Red streams = Flooding (overloaded)
🚨 Gray dim streams = Stagnant (blocked)
🚨 No resonance lines = Team not collaborating
🚨 All dormant orbs = Nothing being worked on

## ❓ Common Confusions Clarified

### "I created a stream but don't see it in Observatory"
- Refresh the page (auto-refresh is every 30s)
- OR go back to `/streams` and click "View in Observatory"

### "My work item shows 0 active / 0 crystals"
- You need to ADD work items to the stream
- Click "+ Spark Item" on the stream card in `/streams`

### "What's the difference between /streams and /observatory?"
- **Streams** = List view (practical, for creating/managing)
- **Observatory** = 3D view (visual, for monitoring/diving)
- Use Streams for setup, Observatory for overview

### "How do I update a work item's progress?"
- Currently: Dive into stream in Observatory → Click item
- Future: Edit modal will allow direct energy level updates
- For now: Use the API or database scripts

### "Where do I see pings I received?"
- Check the bell icon (inbox) - coming soon!
- For now: Pings are stored in database
- Use `/api/pings` to see them

**The main idea**: 
Your team's work is **energy flowing through streams**. You visualize it, track it, and collaborate on it in a beautiful cosmic interface.

**Start simple**:
1. Create streams (projects)
2. Add items (tasks)
3. Work on them (change states)
4. See your crystals grow! 💎
