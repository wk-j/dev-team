# Resonance Network — Team View

## Concept
The Resonance Network abandons the "employee directory" model. Instead, team members exist as **celestial bodies in a living solar system**, with relationships visualized as gravitational forces, orbital patterns, and energy exchanges.

## The Solar System Model

### Core Principle
Each team member is a **star or planet** with:
- **Mass**: Influence/experience level
- **Brightness**: Current energy state
- **Orbit**: Proximity to active work
- **Moons**: Mentees or close collaborators

### System Layout
```
                     ★ Team Lead (Sun)
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           │               │               │
      ◐ Senior Dev    ◐ Senior Dev    ◐ Designer
      (Inner Orbit)   (Inner Orbit)   (Inner Orbit)
           │               │
     ○ ○ Junior      ○ Junior

## Member Celestial Bodies

### Star Types (Based on Role/Seniority)

| Type | Visual | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Sun** | ★ Brilliant white-gold | Team leads, highest gravitational pull |
| **Giant Star** | ◐ Large, warm orange | Senior members, strong influence |
| **Main Sequence** | ● Medium, steady blue-white | Core team members |
| **Dwarf Star** | ○ Small, energetic | Junior members, high potential |
| **Neutron Star** | ◇ Small but intense | Specialists, dense expertise |

### Body Properties

**Core Glow**: Member's energy state

```

**Orbital Ring**: Current engagement level
- **Tight orbit**: Deep in focused work
- **Wide orbit**: Open for collaboration
- **Elliptical**: Fluctuating availability

**Corona/Aura**: Expertise visualization
- Multiple colored rings showing skill domains
- Brighter = stronger in that area

## Resonance Connections

### What is Resonance?
Resonance is the **quality and frequency of collaboration** between two members. Higher resonance = stronger working relationship.

### Visual Representation
Connections appear as **energy bridges** between celestial bodies:

```
    ★ Alex ═══════════════ ★ Maya
         (Strong Resonance)

    ● Jordan ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ● Sam
         (Weak Resonance)

    ◐ Chen ~~~~~~~~~~~► ○ Lee
         (Mentor Flow)
```

**Connection Types:**
| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `═══` Solid bright | Active collaboration this week |
| `─ ─` Dashed dim | Historical connection, currently dormant |
| `~~~►` Wavy directional | Mentorship/knowledge transfer |
| `⚡⚡⚡` Electric sparks | Pair programming live |

### Resonance Score
Each pair has a score (0-100) based on:
- Co-authored commits
- Shared stream participation
- Ping response times
- Meeting overlap
- Peer recognition

## Member States (Orbital Modes)

### 1. Open Orbit
```
    ◐  ← Normal glow
   ╱ ╲
  ╱   ╲  Wide orbital ring
 ╱     ╲
```
- **Meaning**: Available for pings, open to collaboration
- **Visual**: Wide, welcoming aura
- **Behavior**: Quick ping response expected

### 2. Deep Work Orbit
```
      ◐  ← Focused glow
     [█]  Shield indicator
```
- **Meaning**: In flow state, minimize interruptions
- **Visual**: Protective shield around body
- **Behavior**: Pings queue, no immediate response expected

### 3. Recovery Orbit
```
     ◐  ← Dim, pulsing slowly
    zzz
```
- **Meaning**: Low energy, recharging
- **Visual**: Dimmed, slow breathing animation
- **Behavior**: Light work only, respect recovery

### 4. Supernova Mode
```
    ✸ ✸
   ✸ ◐ ✸  ← Explosive energy
    ✸ ✸
```
- **Meaning**: Peak performance, shipping major work
- **Visual**: Radiant burst effect
- **Behavior**: Celebrate and support

### 5. Eclipse (Away)
```
     ◐   ← Darkened
    ███  Shadow overlay
```
- **Meaning**: Out of office, vacation, or offline
- **Visual**: Shadow passes over the body
- **Behavior**: Redirect work to others

## Interaction Design

### Approaching a Member
1. **Hover**: Body brightens, shows quick info tooltip
2. **Click Once**: Camera orbits to show member's profile
3. **Click Again**: Enter their personal space (see their view)

### Sending a Resonance Ping
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Ping Sarah Chen?                  │
│                                    │
│  ○ Gentle ripple (async)           │
│  ◐ Warm pulse (when available)     │
│  ● Direct beam (urgent)            │
│                                    │
│  Message: ___________________      │
│                                    │
│         [Send Ping]                │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Pings travel visually across the void:
- **Gentle ripple**: Slow, subtle wave that arrives softly
- **Warm pulse**: Glowing orb that waits in their orbit
- **Direct beam**: Straight laser that demands attention

### Forming Resonance (New Collaboration)
When two members start working together:
1. Connection line begins to form (faint)
2. Grows stronger with each interaction
3. After threshold: "Resonance Established" celebration
4. Line becomes permanent part of the network

## Team Patterns View

### Constellation Analysis
Zoom out to see team health patterns:

**Healthy Patterns:**
- Even distribution of connections
- No isolated members
- Strong mentor-mentee flows
- Active resonance near project clusters

**Warning Patterns:**
- Single point of failure (one sun too central)
- Isolated dwarf stars (junior member alone)
- Dead resonance lines (people who should connect but don't)
- Orbit collisions (too many on same work)

### Heat Map Overlay
Toggle to see:
- **Collaboration heat**: Where is energy concentrating?
- **Mentorship flow**: Is knowledge spreading evenly?
- **Bottleneck detection**: Who is overloaded?

## Personal Orbit View

Clicking your own celestial body reveals your personal solar system:

```
                 Your Work Items
                  ◇   ◇   ◇
                   \  |  /
                    \ | /

              Your Crystals (Achievements)
```

### Your Orbit Contains:
- **Inner ring**: Current work items (energy state visible)
- **Outer ring**: Connected team members
- **Trail**: Your recent activity path
- **Crystal collection**: Your personal achievements

## Management Tools

### For Team Leads (Sun View)

**Orbit Health Monitor:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Team Orbit Health               │

│ Energy Average   █████████░ 88% │
│                                 │
│ ⚠ Alert: Sam appears isolated   │
│ 💡 Suggest: Connect Sam + Jordan │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Gravitational Adjustments:**
- Suggest new connections
- Redistribute work orbits
- Identify burnout risk (erratic orbits)
- Celebrate strong resonance pairs

## Adding New Members

### The Birth of a Star
When someone joins the team:
1. A **nebula cloud** appears at edge of system
2. Cloud coalesces over onboarding period
3. New star ignites with small celebration
4. Mentor connection forms immediately
5. Star gradually finds its natural orbit

### Ritual:
- Team sees "New star forming in [Team] system"
- Existing members can send "welcome resonance" pings
- First week: Star has protective nebula (learning mode)

---

## Departure Ceremony

### When a Member Leaves
Instead of abrupt removal:
1. Star announces "entering final orbit"
2. Knowledge transfer connections strengthen
3. Star gradually dims over transition period
4. Finally transforms into a **memorial comet**
5. Comet occasionally passes through system (alumni energy)

### Memorial Comets
- Named after departed members
- Carry their contribution history
- Pass through occasionally as reminder
- Click to see their legacy
