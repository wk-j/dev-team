# The Observatory — Main Dashboard

## Concept
The Observatory is not a "dashboard" — it's a **living viewport into the team's collective consciousness**. Users observe their team's energy from a cosmic vantage point, watching work flow like celestial bodies in motion.

---

## The Void Canvas

### Infinite Space
The Observatory exists within "The Void" — an infinite, zoomable dark canvas:
- **Default View**: Shows team constellation at comfortable overview distance
- **Zoom In**: Navigate to individual streams, members, or work items
- **Zoom Out**: See patterns across weeks/months of activity

### Ambient Life
The void is never static:
- Distant particle streams flow slowly in the background
- Nebula clouds shift subtly based on time of day
- Stars (team members) twinkle with their current activity level

## Core Visual Elements

### 1. The Constellation Map (Center Focus)

Team members appear as **luminous nodes** arranged organically:

```
        ★ Maya (Blazing)
       /  \
      /    \
   ★ Alex ──── ★ Jordan
    (Kindling)   (Cooling)
      \         /
       \       /
        ★ Sam
       (Dormant)
```

**Node Properties:**
- **Size**: Proportional to current energy output
- **Color**: Matches their primary energy state
- **Pulse Rate**: Faster = more active right now
- **Connection Lines**: Glow brighter when members collaborate

**Interaction:**
- Hover: Node expands, shows member's current stream + status
- Click: Camera smoothly flies to member's personal space
- Drag: Rearrange constellation to your preference (persists)

---

### 2. Energy Streams (Peripheral Flow)

Work streams flow around the constellation like orbital rivers:

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════
   ~~~~ API Redesign Stream ~~~~ (3 divers)
══════════════════════════════════════════════

          ═══════════════════════
   ≋≋≋≋ Mobile App Stream ≋≋≋≋ (1 diver)
          ═══════════════════════
```

**Stream Properties:**
- **Width**: Number of active contributors
- **Speed**: Current velocity (work being completed)
- **Brightness**: Priority/urgency level
- **Particles**: Individual work items flowing downstream

**Interaction:**
- Hover: Stream highlights, shows quick stats
- Click: "Dive in" — enter immersive stream view
- Right-click: Fork, merge, or archive stream

---

### 3. The Pulse Core (Bottom Left)

A **breathing orb** that represents collective team energy:

```
    ╭─────────────╮
    │  ◉ ◉ ◉ ◉ ◉  │  ← Heartbeat rhythm
    │    ████     │  ← Energy level fill
    │  Team Pulse │
    │   72 BPM    │  ← Metaphorical "heart rate"
    ╰─────────────╯
```

**Pulse Metrics:**
- **BPM (Beats Per Minute)**: Derived from aggregate activity frequency
- **Energy Level**: Visual fill showing team's collective state
- **Rhythm Pattern**: Shows if team is in sync or scattered

**Behavior:**
- Low energy morning: Slow, dim pulse
- Peak flow hours: Rapid, bright pulsing
- End of day: Gradual slowdown

---

### 4. Crystal Garden (Bottom Right)

A growing collection of **crystallized accomplishments**:

```
    ╭───────────────────╮
    │   ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇   │
    │  ◇ ◆ ◇ ◆ ◇ ◆ ◇   │  ← Each crystal = completed work
    │    This Week: 23   │
    │    All Time: 847   │
    ╰───────────────────╯
```

**Crystal Properties:**
- **Size**: Effort/complexity of completed work
- **Color**: Category (feature, fix, research, etc.)
- **Brightness**: How recently crystallized
- **Formation**: Clusters form for related work

**Interaction:**
- Hover: See what the crystal represents
- Click: View details + celebration replay
- Zoom: See patterns in crystal garden over time

---

### 5. Intention Wheel (Contextual)

Appears on **press-and-hold** anywhere on the void:

```
           Find Person
              ╱
      New Work ──◉── Active Streams
              ╲
           My Focus
```

**Wheel Segments:**
- **Find Person**: Search/navigate to team member
- **Active Streams**: Jump to stream list
- **New Work**: Spark a new dormant seed
- **My Focus**: Return to your personal orbital view

---

## Ambient Information Layers

### Time Glow
The void's ambient color shifts with time:
- **Morning**: Deep blue with golden edge
- **Midday**: Brighter, more neutral
- **Evening**: Purple-pink dusk tones
- **Night**: Deep navy with star emphasis

### Weather System (Metaphorical)
Optional ambient indicators of team state:
- **Clear Skies**: Team is flowing well
- **Gathering Clouds**: Blockers detected
- **Storm Warning**: Multiple urgent items or conflicts
- **Rainbow**: Recent big wins

## Observatory Modes

### 1. Observe Mode (Default)
Passive viewing — watch the team constellation breathe and streams flow.

### 2. Navigate Mode
Active exploration — click and drag to pan, scroll to zoom, click nodes to travel.

### 3. Command Mode
Press `/` to open command palette for power users:
- `/find sarah` — Navigate to Sarah
- `/stream api` — Open API stream
- `/spark new feature` — Create new dormant work
- `/focus 2h` — Enter personal focus mode for 2 hours

---

## Data Visualization Philosophy

### No Charts, No Graphs
Traditional dashboards use bar charts and line graphs. The Observatory uses:
- **Spatial Relationships**: Distance = connection strength
- **Motion**: Speed/rhythm = activity level
- **Light**: Brightness = energy/priority
- **Growth**: Crystal accumulation = progress over time

### Glanceable Health
At a glance, a healthy team shows:
- Evenly distributed constellation (no one isolated)
- Flowing streams (not stagnant)
- Steady pulse (not erratic or flatlined)
- Growing crystal garden (continuous delivery)

---

## Accessibility Modes

### High Contrast Mode
- Void becomes pure black
- All elements get solid color fills
- Connection lines become dashed/labeled

### Flat View Mode
- Disables 3D depth and particle effects
- Shows clean 2D diagram layout
- Reduces motion to essentials

### Screen Reader Mode
- Announces: "Dashboard loaded. 5 team members active. API Stream has 3 divers. Team pulse is steady at 68 BPM."
- Keyboard navigation through all elements
