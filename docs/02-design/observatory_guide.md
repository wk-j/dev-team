# Observatory Guide

The Observatory is your command center - a living visualization of your team's energy and work flow.

## Stats Bar

The top stats bar shows real-time team metrics:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Team Pulse** | Collective energy rhythm (BPM). Higher = more activity |
| **Active Streams** | Streams with work in progress. Shows how many are "rushing" |
| **Crystals Today** | Work items completed today |
| **Team Diving** | Team members currently focused in streams |

---

## 3D Canvas Elements

### Team Members (Celestial Bodies)

Team members appear as glowing spheres with unique properties:

| Color | Role | Star Type |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Yellow/Gold | Team Lead | Sun |
| Orange | Senior Developer | Giant |
| Cyan/Blue | Developer | Main Sequence |
| Pink | Junior Developer | Dwarf |
| Purple | Specialist | Neutron |

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Ring around member** = Currently in "focused" or "deep work" state
- **Brightness** = Current energy level
- **Pulsing** = Active/available for collaboration

### Orbital States

| State | Appearance | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Open | Normal glow | Available for interaction |
| Focused | Ring visible | Concentrated on work |
| Deep Work | Intense ring, dimmed | Do not disturb |
| Away | Faded | Offline or unavailable |
| Supernova | Bright burst | High energy moment |

---

### Streams (Flowing Lines)

Streams are curved lines with particles flowing along them, representing work flows:

| Line Color | Stream State | Meaning |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| Yellow | Rushing | High velocity, lots of activity |
| Cyan | Flowing | Normal healthy pace |
| Gray (dim) | Nascent | New stream, just starting |
| Gray (murky) | Stagnant | Blocked or abandoned |
| Red | Flooding | Overloaded, needs attention |

**Visual Elements:**
- **Particles moving along line** = Work flowing through the stream
- **Line thickness** = Stream priority/importance
- **Health orb at start** = Stream health indicator

### Stream Health Indicators

At the start of each stream, a pulsing orb shows stream health:

| Orb Color | Health Label | Meaning |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Gray | New | Just created |
| Green | Healthy | Normal flow |
| Yellow | Active | High activity |
| Red | Overloaded | Too much work |
| Orange | Stagnant | Needs attention |
| Dark gray | Archived | Evaporated/complete |

**Hover over stream** to see:
- Stream name
- Health status
- Item count
- Crystals (completed items)

### Work Items (Energy Orbs)

Work items appear as spheres with different appearances based on their energy state:

| Appearance | Energy State | Description |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Dim gray sphere | Dormant | Not yet started, waiting for energy |
| Orange flickering | Kindling | Someone started working on it |
| Bright yellow pulsing | Blazing | Active work, full energy |
| Purple fading | Cooling | Wrapping up, nearly complete |
| Faceted crystal | Crystallized | Complete! Permanent gem |

**Size indicates depth:**
- Small = Shallow (quick task)
- Medium = Medium complexity
- Large = Deep work
- Extra large = Abyssal (massive undertaking)

---

### Resonance Connections

Faint curved lines between team members show collaboration strength:

| Line Brightness | Connection Strength |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Barely visible | Weak connection |
| Subtle glow | Moderate collaboration |
| Bright line | Strong partnership |

Connections grow stronger through:
- Shared work items
- Shared streams
- Ping exchanges

---

## Interactions

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Drag** | Rotate the 3D view |
| **Scroll** | Zoom in/out |
| **Hover stream** | Show stream info tooltip |
| **Click stream** | Enter Dive Mode (immersive focus) |
| **Hover work item** | Show item details |
| **Hover team member** | Show member profile |

---

## Dive Mode

When you click a stream, you enter **Dive Mode** - a full-screen immersive view:

- All other elements fade away
- Focus on the selected stream's work items
- See fellow divers (team members in the same stream)
- Click work items to see details and kindle them
- Click "Surface" to return to Observatory view

## Reading the Flow

The Observatory tells a story:

1. **Team constellation** = Who's on your team and their roles
2. **Stream rivers** = Where work is flowing
3. **Energy orbs** = Individual work items and their progress
4. **Connections** = How the team collaborates
5. **Crystals** = Completed accomplishments

A healthy team shows:
- Multiple flowing streams (not stagnant)
- Work items progressing through energy states
- Team members distributed across streams
- Strong resonance connections between collaborators
